# Personalized Learning Models for Neurodivergent Students

This project investigates how student engagement data can be used to develop personalized curriculum pathways, with a focus on potential future applications for neurodivergent learners (e.g., students with ADHD or autism). Using clustering and classification techniques, students were grouped into engagement profiles and assigned optimized learning paths.

- `Clustering.ipynb` â€“ Uses KMeans to identify engagement profile groups
- `CurriculumOptimization.ipynb` â€“ Assigns tailored curriculum sequences
- `Classification.ipynb` â€“ Optional: Predicts engagement profile based on features

### Data
- `student_mat_por_clean.csv` â€“ Cleaned academic performance dataset (merged)
- `student_mental_health_clean.csv` â€“ Cleaned mental health survey dataset

# Personalized Learning Models for Neurodivergent Students

This project investigates how student engagement data can be used to develop personalized curriculum pathways, with a focus on potential future applications for neurodivergent learners (e.g., students with ADHD or autism). Using clustering and classification techniques, students were grouped into engagement profiles and assigned optimized learning paths.

## Files Included

### Notebooks
- `DataPreprocessing.ipynb`: Merges and cleans data from multiple sources
- `ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb`: Visualizes patterns, trends, and distributions
- `Clustering.ipynb`: Uses KMeans to identify engagement profile groups
- `CurriculumOptimization.ipynb`: Assigns tailored curriculum sequences
- `Classification.ipynb`: Predicts engagement profile based on features

### Data
- `student_mat_por_clean.csv`: Cleaned academic performance dataset (merged)
- `student_mental_health_clean.csv`: Cleaned mental health survey dataset
- `assessments_clean.csv`: Cleaned assessments dataset (Open University)
- `courses_clean.csv`: Cleaned courses metadata
- `vle_clean.csv`: Cleaned Virtual Learning Environment interaction data
- `engagement_profile_sample.csv`: Sample of final dataset (used for modeling)

> ðŸ”Ž Note: The full cleaned dataset (`engagement_profile_clean.csv`) is not included due to GitHub size limits. A sample is provided.
